# Code for a manuscript "Ship and ground-based lidar and radiosonde evaluation of Southern Ocean clouds in the storm-resolving general circulation model ICON and the ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalyses"

This repository contains code for the manuscript "Ship and ground-based lidar
and radiosonde evaluation of Southern Ocean clouds in the storm-resolving
general circulation model ICON and the ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalyses" (DOI:
[10.5281/zenodo.14071808](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14071808)).

Due to space requirements (~1 TB), we do not include the source data here. They
have to be either obtained from the various original sources (see the Open
Research Section in the manuscript), or requested from the authors. The latter
might be a better option because it can take a large amount of time to download
some of the data, such as ERA5, from the original repositories.

The code in this repository is for running all of the data processing steps and
plotting, in addition to downloading the reanalysis data and extracting ICON
data on the Levante supercomputer.

## Requirements

The code should work on any standard Linux distribution. It has been developed
and tested on Devuan GNU/Linux 5 (daedalus). Running the code on other Windows
or macOS might be possible, but has not been tested. On Windows, it might be
possible to run it most easily under the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

The commands are to be run in the terminal, such as GNU Bash. Specifically,
some of the command-line syntax is not compatible with `zsh` (the default shell
on macOS). The use the commands on macOS (untested), it is recommended to start
the `bash` shell first.

The version numbers are advisory, and the code might work with earlier versions
as well.

- Python >= 3.11
- cdo >= 2.1.1
- GNU parallel >= 20221122
- R >= 4.2.2 (for map plotting only)

Python packages:

- alcf, a custom version available at [peterkuma/icon-so-2024-alcf](https://github.com/peterkuma/icon-so-2024-alcf)
- aquarius_time >= 0.4.0
- cartopy >= 0.21.1
- ds_format >= 4.1.0
- matplotlib >= 3.7.2
- numpy >= 1.24.2
- pst-format >= 2.0.0
- pyproj >= 3.4.1
- rstool >= 1.1.0
- scipy >= 1.10.1
- shapely >= 1.8.5

In addition, running code for extracting ICON data on the Levante supercomputer
on DKRZ requires the following Python packages:

- healpy >= 1.16.6
- intake >= 0.6.8

R packages (for map plotting only):

- rgdal >= 1.6
- sp >= 1.6

To install the required packages on Debian-based Linux distributions:

```sh
apt install python3 r-base r-cran-gdal r-cran-sp cdo
```

To avoid compatibility issues, it is recommended to install the specific
versions of the required Python packages (listed in the file
`requirements.txt`) in a Python virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

This also activates the environment for the current session. After finishing
working with the code, the environment can be deactivated with `deactivate`.

To run the cyclone tracking commands, download and upack version 1.0.1 of
[CyTRACK](https://github.com/apalarcon/CyTRACK):

```sh
wget -O CyTRACK-1.0.1.tar.gz https://github.com/apalarcon/CyTRACK/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.1.tar.gz
tar xf CyTRACK-1.0.1.tar.gz
mv CyTRACK-1.0.1 cytrack
```

## Input data

The directory `input` should be populated with the input data before running
the commands documented below, except for reanalysis data along the
voyage/station locations, which can be downloaded with the `download_merra2`
and `download_era5` commands.

The input data is expected to be organized in `input` in multiple directory
as follow.

### ceres

Directory with CERES `SYN1deg-Day_Terra-Aqua-MODIS_Edition4A` NetCDF files
(years 2010-2021). These can be produced by converting the CERES HDF files
to NetCDF with [h4toh5](https://www.hdfeos.org/software/h4toh5.php).

### era5

This directory should contain the following subdirectories:

- `cyc`: ERA5 surface-level 6-hourly instantaneous NetCDF files with the
  variables `latitude`, `longitude`, `msl`, `time`, `u10`, `v10` (years
  2010-2021).
- `lts/plev`: ERA5 pressure-level 6-hourly instantaneous NetCDF files with the
  variables `latitude`, `longitude`, `t`, and `time`, merged by time (with cdo
  or `ds merge`) into yearly files `2010.nc`, ..., `2013.nc`.
- `lts/surf`: The same as above, but for surface-level and the variables
  `latitude`, `longitude`, `sp`, `t2m`, and `valid_time`.

### natural_earth

This directory should contain a single subdirectory `ne_50m_land`, with data
extracted from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) (1:50m
Physical Vectors Land). This is only required for map plotting.

### obs

subdirectories.

#### lidar

  campaign (`HMNZSW16`, `NBP1704`, `TAN1702`, and `TAN1802`), containing
  NetCDF files extracted from the corresponding Lufft CHM 15k archives in the
  manuscript data repository (DOI:
  [10.5281/zenodo.14422427](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14422427)) and the
  TAN1802 repository (DOI:
  [10.5281/zenodo.4060236](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4060236)).
- `cl51/dat`: The same as above, but containing the Vaisala
  CL51 DAT files for the `AA15-16`, `TAN1502`, and the RV *Polarstern* voyages.
  The RV *Polarstern* voyages should use the `PS`*...* names, not the
  `ANT-`*...* names. See the file `ps_voyage_name_map.csv` for mapping between
  the two.
- `cl51/nc`: The same as above, but containing files converted
  from DAT to NetCDF with [cl2nc](https://github.com/peterkuma/cl2nc).

  NetCDF files for the `MARCUS` and `MICRE` campaigns, downloaded from
  [ARM](https://www.arm.gov).

#### rs

This directory should contain subdirectories for each campaign which has
radiosonde data available.

- `MARCUS`: This directory should contain NetCDF files from the corresponding
  ARM archive containing the `marsondewnpnM1.b1`*...* files.
- `NBP1704` and `TAN1702`: These directories should contain the files extracted
  from the corresponding archives for radiosondes in the manuscript data
  repository. `NBP1704` should contain NetCDF files. `TAN1702` should contain
  directories produced by the InterMet Systems software, one per radiosonde
  launch.
- `PS`*...* exept `PS111`-`PS124`: Directories for the RV *Polarstern* voyages,
  each containing a file `summary.txt` and a subdirectory `tab` with `.tab`
  files coming from the RV *Polarstern* repositories for upper air data on
  Pangaea. In addition, a file `summary_wo_header.tab` and subdirectory
  `tab_wo_header` should be created, containing the same files, but with the
  headers removed (text between `/*` and `*/`).
- `PS111`-`PS124`: The same as above, but containing files
  `PS`*...*`_radiosonde.tab` and `PS`*...*`_radiosonde_wo_header.tab`, which
  is the same as the former but with the headers removed.
- `TAN1802`: The same as `TAN1702`, but extracted from the TAN1802 data
  repository archive with the Intermet Systems radiosonde data.

#### surf

This directory should contain subdirectories for the following campaings:

- `AA15-16`: This subdirectory should contain CSV files extracted from the
  corresponding surfave archive in the manuscript data repository.
- `HMNZSW16` and `NBP1704`: The same as above, but MATLAB files for the
  corresponding campaings.
- `PS/metcont/tab`: This subdirectory should contain `.tab` files named
  `PS`*voyage`.tab` from the continuous meteorological measurement archives of
  the RV *Polarstern* voyages from Pangaea.
- `PS/metcont/tab_wo_header`: The same as above, but with `.tab` files with the
  headers removed.
- `PS/metcont_extra`: This subdirectory should contain files copied from
  the `ps_metcont_extra` directory in this repository.
- `PS/thermosalinograph/tab`: The same as `PS/metcont/tab`, but for `.tab`
  files from the voyage thermosalinograph archives on Pangaea.
- `PS/thermosalinograph/tab_wo_header`: The same as above, but with `.tab`
  files with the headers removed.
